# Hints and Tips :tada:

- Think about what would make this HTML accessible for another developer?

  - Is the HTML & CSS semantic?

- Is there code documentation inside the HTML and CSS?

- What makes this website more accessible? What happens if the images don’t load?

- When going through the code, if something doesn’t make sense then call it out and refactor it? Is there something that’s not descriptive?

- Do all of the functions of the website work consistently and correctly and between each other?

  > E.g. I click one thing, does it act like the other?

- Make sure you refer back to the class recording, we covered a lot of this in the session! :grin:

# General advice :thinking:

1. You have 2 folders: `Develop` and `Master`. Treat `Develop` as if it was your own branch and work on the files from that folder. `Master` is acting like the original copy or a backup in this scenario. If something goes wrong, or you need to restart you can take the files from master.

2. Copy the `Develop` folder that is inside of this `Homework` folder and use that as your **starter folder** for your homework in the GitHub repository that you're setting up for this homework.

3. Make sure the files and the structure are consistent, don’t call something `homework_html_5` then call another one `homeWork5HtMl` - even if the latter looks l33t :wink:

4. Each time you make a change, e.g. you fix something, or you change the way something works - commit this!

5. Maybe screenshot the website working just in case the next developer cannot get it running on their machine?

6. As a final point, if you we're to hand this over to another developer, would they understand it as well as you do now?

   > Go back through the code and treat it as if you had just downloaded your own repo for the first time. Does it make sense?
